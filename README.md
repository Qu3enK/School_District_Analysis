# Summary
The analysis of the Student Data yielded that the overall average math and reading scores are 64.8 and 72.4 respectively.  The Charter and Public Schools reading averages, 72.6 and 72.2 respectively, are in-line with the overall reading average score; however the Charter Schools average math scores are above the overall math average at 66.7.

Although the Public Schools average math score (62.9) is below the overall average math score (64.8), when reviewed by # grade level the math scores for the 9th, 10th and 12th grades are fairly close at 63 to the overall math average.

Analysis of the school budget show the average budget for the Public Schools was larger than the Charter Schools (911,195.56 and 872,625.66 respectively), however their average math scores are below the overall average math score.

Note there were approximately 4000+ records dropped due to null values or duplicates which may have impacted the results.

Additional analysis that could be performed with the students is to review math and reading averages
    * per high school
    * by type per high school
    * by grade level per high school
    
    
    
    
    
    
**Note:  The summary (Deliverable 6) was included in the initial push/submission of the Challenge. However, it appears to have been omitted. I have made a few attempts to have it show in the respository without much luck. I am including the summary in the ReadMe file as not to lose points due to technical/application issues.
